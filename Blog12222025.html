                &emsp;&emsp;The weather is so cool rencently that I often get up late in these days.
                I got up at eight o'clock,having breakfast before going to the library,Becuuse I felt
                tired, I
                decided
                to study in a studying room in the first floor.
                As soon as I had walk into the room, I started to find a seat which makes me
                comfortable.
                A short while gone,I found a desk in a corner,and then I take the one of seats of the
                desk.I
                didn't
                realized a romantic thing will annoying me.<br />
                &emsp;&emsp;After I sit the my seat, a girl took the seat of the desk. I thought If I
                could pick
                up
                her.
                Shortly,I threw my thought, because her boyfriend came here. They talked a minute, and
                the boy
                sit
                next
                to me.
                It doesn't matter even they called each other's swety nickname.I can't bear until one of
                the
                laptop's
                fan make some noise. I ready to leave, while I had a glance of the laptop screen, in
                which there
                is
                an
                IE browser coin.<br />
                In the end I had left for the second floor. I thought the experience is so funny and
                romantic.
                There
                are
                variety of people in the world.In Chinese, we say <q class="chart">林子大了什么鸟都有</q>.<br />

                after I walked two lap, seeing a girl with ahandbag.
                I don't care about this. When I near her, she suddenly walked promptly away from
                me.
