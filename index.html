                &emsp;&emsp; First of all, I am glad that you typed and tapped the link
                to my blog.
                this blog is
                private, but I opened for everyone who would like to know about me. If
                it makes you happy, I
                will so. If it make you anxtious or angry, I can beg you sign out this
                website, because this
                is a website, not being responsible for anything.You can tap the date of
                bookmark to sikp the blog.<br />
                &emsp;&emsp;And second, I will said the reason why I set my blog and always update it.
                I was set it at the age of 22, when I was at my university leaving there next year.
                I am always lonly on my emotion, because I thought my youth is a joke, which was created by myself.
                I don't have a few friends, not developing a hobby.In the winter, I read a PDF about dating with
                housewives.
                The writer have been running his blog from his junior school.
                Suddenly, I reminded of I learnt html last year and I had set a ugly blog, so I can set my blog
                again.
                I don't know how to use the felx layout before I set this web.
                After then I coded the web and learnt flex layout, although I can't compeletly know that but I know
                its
                usage.<br />
                &emsp;&emsp;In the end, I hope you will got some calm here, which made my happy, becasue I must feel
                my
                value from your feeling. I continue learning the web, so that there will be a comments box here in
                the
                future.
            </p>
